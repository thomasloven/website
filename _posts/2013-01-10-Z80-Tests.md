Six or seven years ago, I bought a box full of fun stuff on eBay. It
turned out to include a few Z80 processors. I had just finished my army
duty and still remembered the math and physics lectures from college
(equivalent) where most of the time had been wasted playing Super Mario
on our Texas Intruments TI83+ graphing calculators who run on the very
same processor. So I was well aware on what wonders it's capable of.
Unfortunately, I didn't even have time to start playing with my new
goodies before I went to university and my life turned into a mess.

The time finally came about a year and a half ago. I was having the
first vacation of my life and actually had time to spare.
