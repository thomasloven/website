I'm not really a ruby kind of guy, but this page runs on
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Sass.](http://sass-lang.com/) anyway.

The color scheme is based on
[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) and the font is
[Aver√≠a](http://iotic.com/averia/) which is an idea I really like.

Code snippets are displayed using
[google-code-prettify](http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/) with
some custom syntax files by me.
